## When will it be released?

In the meantime, you can [follow my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ron-nuss-28b762274/), I will post updates and previews about the extension there.

## What is the search engine the extension use?
The extension uses the DuckDuckGo Instant Answer API.

## License?
Definitely. I believe that as a developer, if I worked hard on a project I expect other people to respect me and give me some credit if my code is being used. The BlueChat project is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/itsrn/bluechat/blob/main/LICENSE).

Please note that the BlueChat extension uses the [HuggingFace space - ChatGPT-prompt-generator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/merve/ChatGPT-prompt-generator) to generate the prompts, so the credit to that feature is for [merve](https://huggingface.co/merve), who created this space. The logo of the extension was took from [ChatGPT's wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ChatGPT_logo.svg) (with a little color changing).
